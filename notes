truffle CLI + console commands

truffle compile
 - simply compiles code after changes have been made to prepare for deployment

 truffle migrate
 - applies smart contracts to the blockchain
 - --reset tag will renew existing smart contracts if changes have been made

truffle console
 - start truffle console

    varName = await variable
     - asynchronous call to get variable from existing smart contract
     - note that the contract has to be deployed. 



Other notes
- have to connect the browser to the blockchain -> use metamask
- need client side to connect to the blockchain -> web3 allows for communication
